üíª 1. Check If Java Is Already Installed
Before installing, check if Java is already on your system:

Windows / Mac / Linux Terminal Command:
nginx
Copy
Edit
java -version
If Java is installed, you'll see the version number. If not, follow the steps below.

üîΩ 2. Download Java Development Kit (JDK)
Go to the official Oracle JDK download page or use an open-source version like Adoptium.
Choose the correct version for your operating system:
Windows (.exe)
macOS (.dmg)
Linux (.tar.gz)
I recommend downloading the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version for stability.

üèóÔ∏è 3. Install Java on Your System
üîµ On Windows:
Run the downloaded .exe file.
Follow the setup wizard and note the installation path (usually C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-version).
Set up environment variables:
Search "Environment Variables" in Windows search.
Click "Environment Variables..." under System Properties.
Under System Variables, click New and add:
Variable name: JAVA_HOME
Variable value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-version
Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin to the Path variable.
üçè On macOS:
Open the .dmg file and follow the installation steps.
Add Java to your PATH:
Open Terminal and run:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/paths
Add this line (replace version as needed):
swift
Copy
Edit
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-version/Contents/Home/bin
Save and close (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).
üêß On Linux (Ubuntu):
Update packages:
sql
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
Install Java:
nginx
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
Verify installation:
nginx
Copy
Edit
java -version
‚úÖ 4. Verify the Java Installation
Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:

nginx
Copy
Edit
java -version
You should see output showing the installed Java version.

üîß 5. Set Up a Code Editor or IDE
Install an IDE for writing and running Java code easily:

IntelliJ IDEA (Highly recommended for beginners)
Eclipse (Great for large projects)
Visual Studio Code (Lightweight with Java extensions)
üöÄ 6. Write and Run Your First Java Program
Try running a simple Java program to confirm everything works:

Create a new file called HelloWorld.java.
Paste this code:
java
Copy
Edit
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java is successfully set up!");
    }
}
Open terminal/command prompt, navigate to the file location, and run:
nginx
Copy
Edit
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
If everything is set up correctly, you should see:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Java is successfully set up!
